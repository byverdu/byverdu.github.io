I am a Junior Web Developer based in London that loves spend time with all that is Tech related, lately I have found that what I really enjoy is coding.

Since I read my first line of code back in 2012 I have been learning as much as I can about the world wide web, everything is much more clear after attending [MakersAcademy](http://www.makersacademy.com). After this experience I want to focus on a MEAN stack but keeping an eye in Ruby,  now I can not concede any code without being tested.

## Code examples 

> [MakersAcademy Employers page](http://www.makersacademy.com/employers)

[Sample images for old/new design](/demos/cv_images)

After I finished at @MakersAcademy I had the opportunity to implement the new design for the MakersAcademy employers page, great challenge converting a psd file into a fully functional web page only using Sass.


> [SparkPrinter](http://spark-print-staging.herokuapp.com/)

Final project at @MakersAcademy, Our team used [The Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/), a Wi-Fi development kit that lets you connect products using the cloud. Our project consists in integrate a RFID-enabled device with the Spark core and a printer. A user can setup his preferences and printing them by passing a RFID card.

> [KitchenFlow](https://github.com/byverdu/kitchen_flow)

Description about the process that take place when a costumer goes to a Restaurant, the code is written following Test Driven Development with Ruby and RSpec.

> [SpockLizard](http://spock-lizard.herokuapp.com/)

Sinatra web app where you can play with the game Rock Paper Scissors Spock and Lizard. Unit tests using Jasmine and Integration tests using Capybara, the CSS files are compiled using SCSS.
