I am a Junior Web Developer based in London that loves to spend time with all that is tech-related; lately I have found that what I really enjoy is coding.

Since I read my first line of code back in 2012 I have been learning as much as I can about the world wide web. Everything is much more clear after attending Makers Academy. After this experience I want to focus on a MEAN stack and use Test Driven Development to write my code.

## Web Development

#### `Makers Academy Aug 2014 - Oct 2014`

I attended this twelve week web programming bootcamp, focused on learning full stack web development using cutting edge technologies.

#### `JavaScript course at UOC Sept 2012 - Dec 2012`

I completed this Front End development trimester at Open University Catalonia mainly focused in Javascript, this is the [Final Project](http://mycoffice.es/web-project/).


## Code examples 

> [MakersAcademy Employers page](http://www.makersacademy.com/employers)

[Sample images for old/new design](/demos/cv_images)

After I finished at @MakersAcademy I had the opportunity to implement the new design for the MakersAcademy employers page, great challenge converting a psd file into a fully functional web page only using Sass.


> [SparkPrinter](http://spark-print-staging.herokuapp.com/)

Final project at @MakersAcademy, Our team used [The Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/), a Wi-Fi development kit that lets you connect products using the cloud. Our project consists in integrate a RFID-enabled device with the Spark core and a printer. A user can setup his preferences and printing them by passing a RFID card.

> [KitchenFlow](https://github.com/byverdu/kitchen_flow)

Description about the process that take place when a costumer goes to a Restaurant, the code is written following Test Driven Development with Ruby and RSpec.

> [SpockLizard](http://spock-lizard.herokuapp.com/)

Sinatra web app where you can play with the game Rock Paper Scissors Spock and Lizard. Unit tests using Jasmine and Integration tests using Capybara, the CSS files are compiled using SCSS.
